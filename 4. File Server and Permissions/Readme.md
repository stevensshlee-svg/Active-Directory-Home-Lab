# Share Permissions
Share levels are set to grant authenticated users full control. From there subfolders and files access controls are granted through NTFS.

# NTFS Permissions
Inheritance is disabled to have a more granular control on who has access to what resource. From there, access is granted through security groups enforcing the principle of least privilege.

# Validation
