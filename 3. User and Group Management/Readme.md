# User Creation
* Created department-based user accounts
* Standard naming convention of first name last name
* Password reset policies tested

# Group strategy
Users were added to department group and department group were added to resource permission group. 
* LA-Finance-Users
* LA-Finance-Share-RW
* LA-Finance-Share-RO  
Using Structured security groups made permission granting more manageable and scalable while reducing the chances of permission creep from occuring.
