# Organizational Structure
The domain was structured by:
  * Location (LA & NY)
  * Department (HR, IT, Finance, Sales, Marketing)
  * Logic (Users, Computers, groups)

# Design Principles
* Separation of users and computers
* Department-based segmentation
* GPO-ready Structure
* Scalability for additional branches

# Why this matters
Proper OU design enables simplified targeted GPO deployment, delegated administration, and easier troubleshooting.
